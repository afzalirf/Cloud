    <h1> <center> Cloud Computing </center> </h1>
    <hr>
    <h3><p>Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and store data, applications, and services over the internet instead of on local computers or physical servers. It provides on-demand access to computing resources such as storage, processing power, and networking, enabling businesses and individuals to scale their operations efficiently. Cloud computing offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and reliability, as users only pay for the resources they use. It also promotes collaboration by allowing multiple users to access the same data or applications from different locations. Major types of cloud computing services include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

    <h2><center><p> There are different types of Clouds</p></center></h2>
    <h2><center>Deployment Models</center></h2>
    <h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Public Cloud – Shared and managed by third-party providers.</li>
        <li>Private Cloud – Used exclusively by one organization.</li>
        <li>Hybrid Cloud – Combines both public and private clouds.</li>

    <ol type="A">
        <h4><li>On-demand self-service – Users can get computing resources whenever needed.</li>

        <li>Broad network access – Services are available over the internet.</li>

        <li>Resource pooling – Resources are shared among multiple users.</li>

        <li>Rapid elasticity – Easy to scale up or down depending on demand.</li>

        <li>Measured service – Pay only for what you use (pay-as-you-go model).</li></h4>
